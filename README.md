Please see below in the original ReadMe from EukaDesigns for instructions.
CaesarDGreat Fork changes from EukaDesign's:
- lowers nozzle temp to 100 deg C to prevent oozing
- removed M109 heating prior to cut filament to reduce wait time
- expanded on wipe section for 4 nozzle wipes each time in multiple places that made sense instead of just 1 nozzle wipe
- added linear movement to re-close chute to allow purged filament to roll after wiping
- added M104 preheat in various places to reduce wait time by maybe a few seconds 
- overall rearranged and cleaned up some gcode for efficiency

Original ReadMe from EukaDesigns:
